**INTRODUCTION**
---
This app uses the make_moons dataset, a two-class “moon-shaped” dataset often used for testing classification
algorithms. It demonstrates how the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier works. Users can adjust parameters such as the
number of neighbors and noise level to see how the decision boundary changes and to better understand the behavior of
KNN in non-linear classification tasks.

**WEB DEVELOPMENT**
